## Analysis of Ride-Sharing Data by City Type

**Purpose & Overview**:

The purpose of this project is to analyze PyBer ride-sharing data to gain actionable intelligence and present related visuals to decision-makers at the company, specifically my client V. Isualize, that she and others may make informed business decisions.
The analysis groups the data into 3 cohorts, based on city-type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural, and provides relevant statistics on each cohort, by city-type: total number of rides, total number of drivers, total fares charged/collected, the average fare per ride and per driver, and the total fare by city type over the 4-month time-span January through April.
My client is interested in understanding and addressing any disparities that exist in the ride-sharing data, which these statistics inform.

**Disparities Between City Types**


## HEADING

analyzing the dataset as a whole would osbcure much of the information that exists because of the different cohort types.  
The given city-type is the independent variable, and as city-types are determined by population density, the city-type determines the number of total drivers, which limits the number of total rides, and through supply and demand, determines what the total fares collected are, resulting in different average fares per Ride and Driver for the 3 cohorts.
