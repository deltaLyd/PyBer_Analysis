## Analysis of Ride-Sharing Data by City Type

**Purpose & Overview**:

The purpose of this project is to analyze PyBer ride-sharing data to gain actionable intelligence and present related visuals to decision-makers at the company, specifically my client V. Isualize, that she and others may make informed business decisions.
The analysis groups the data into 3 cohorts, based on city-type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural, and provides relevant statistics on each cohort, by city-type: total number of rides, total number of drivers, total fares charged/collected, the average fare per ride and per driver, and the total fare by city type over the 4-month time-span January through April.
My client is interested in understanding and addressing any disparities that exist in the ride-sharing data, which these statistics inform.

## Results

**Disparities Between City Types**

This table, created as a summary DataFrame during the analysis, clearly displays relevant information that is the basis for my recommendations to V. Isualize. 

## Summary, Data Limitations & Recommendations

As we only have date-data for 4 months of 2019, we cannot conduct any year-over-year or even quarter-over-quarter data analysis, which would inform what the growth rates for total number of drivers and rides is in each city-type, and then assess that growth vs. the amount of money PyBer has spent building out its business in different city-types, to determine what the best investment for the given dollar is. 

analyzing the dataset as a whole would osbcure much of the information that exists because of the different cohort types.  
The given city-type is the independent variable, and as city-types are determined by population density, the city-type determines the number of total drivers, which limits the number of total rides, and through supply and demand, determines what the total fares collected are, resulting in different average fares per Ride and Driver for the 3 cohorts.
